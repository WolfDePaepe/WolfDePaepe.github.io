            Foreword
        </p>
        <p>
            I was attracted to this topic because of my interest in the EU an climate the field of public policy was however very new to me. Throughout this research I have learned a lot and I have broadened my horizon. I would like to thank my promotor professor Dupont for guiding me through this adventure and my friends and family for supporting me and indulging me in conversation

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Problem statement and relevance</h2>
        <p>
            The EU is an important climate actor with a history of international leadership in the fight against climate change. In the last decades the EU has strengthened its climate ambitions and developed new strategies to reach its goals. Throughout this time, the EU has faced many sometimes coinciding crises, some of which left a lasting legacy with regard to climate policy <cite>Von Homeyer, Oberthür, & Jordan, 2021</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The EU has been under stress since the war in Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis. There is a reasonable expectation that the energy crisis will put pressure on climate ambitions in the EU, which - because of the EU’s critical role in the global fight against climate change - could have far spread consequences. The reopening of coal plants in Germany where the green party is a part of the government and the investments into liquified natural gas <cite>LNG</cite> terminals has raised fear for lock-in effects and waning climate ambition <cite>IEEFA, 2023; Jones, 2022</cite>. The energy crisis could however also have an opposite effect, it could push the EU towards pursuing energy independence through investments in green energy solutions. As of writing, the EU has not explicitly mentioned a change in climate ambition or climate targets. The most recent target is therefore the one set out by the European Climate Law which entered into force in 2021 <cite>Regulation <cite>EU</cite> 2021/1119</cite>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Previous EU crisis and their effects on climate policy have been well studied using numerous frameworks <cite>e.g. Slominski, 2016; Dupont, et al., 2020; Burns, Eckersley, & Tobin, 2020</cite>. The energy crisis however has not resulted in an abundance of research with regard to EU climate policy. This is probably due to its recency and the fact that it is ongoing. Because of the EU’s role as a global leader in the fight against climate change and its position at the epicentre of the energy crisis, I believe it would be valuable to gauge the impact of the energy crisis on EU climate ambitions.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <h2>Research objective</h2>
        <p>
            My primary goal is to asses weather the energy crisis could have a lasting impact on EU climate ambitions. In case the answer to this question is positive, I will seek to gauge the direction of this impact: will climate ambitions be strengthened; plateau; or will the EU dismantle previous policy goals?
        </p>
        <p>
            As explanatory framework in my research, I will use critical juncture theory from new institutionalism, which is an approach for studying the relationship between institutions and political outcomes <cite>Steinmo, 2008</cite>. Historical institutionalism is used to find and explain causal relationships in political history. Here the dual model of institutional change is commonly used <cite>Cappocia, 2015</cite>. History is seen as a continuous equilibrium which is punctuated by short moments of change called critical junctures. If the energy crisis is a critical juncture for climate ambitions, this would mean that it has the potential to have a lasting causal influence on future climate ambition.
        </p>
        <p>
            The concept of critical junctures is similarly used in discursive institutionalism which as the name suggest focuses more on discussion and narratives. I will use elements of discursive institutionalism to legitimise my research and interpret the dynamics of the energy crisis and support my findings.  
        </p>
        <p>
            This leads to the following research question: can the energy crisis stemming from the war in Ukraine be seen as a critical juncture for the EU towards climate neutrality? 
        </p>
        <h2>Research design</h2>
        <p>
            To answer this question, I will use a qualitative method based on grounded theory. I will review documents put forward by the European Council and State of the Union speeches by the European president. I will codify these based on the context in which climate is mentioned. According to discursive institutionalism discourse and ideas can exert causal influence on politics. An increase in the amount of documents that mention climate would indicate that there is a growing discourse surrounding it. A change in context would indicate the prominence of new narratives in the coordinative or communicative discourse. Since these narratives are used to justify policy, a shift in narrative can add or remove policy options. Therefore a combination of the two would indicate a critical juncture. I will also perform a counterfactual analysis to determine whether an alternative path was available and if it would have had a lasting legacy.

        <h1>Historical background</h1>
        <p>
            <i>In this chapter I will provide an overview of the European Union’s recent history in relation to the fight against climate change. Hereby I seek to convey the relevance of the EU’s actions and its role in the global fight against climate change.</i>
        </p>
        <h2>Before the Treaty of Lisbon</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Conclusion: The EU is an international leader in the fight against climate change</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The EU became a noteworthy climate actor in 1992 when it became one of the signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change <cite>from now on UNFCCC</cite>, one of the three Rio conventions <cite>United Nations, n.d.</cite>. In the preceding negotiations the EU supported binding emission reduction targets <cite>Oberthür & Kelly, 2008</cite> but eventually all the parties could agree on was to stabilize emissions at the 1990 level by 2000 <cite>Michaelowa, Betz, 2001</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later in 1997 the EU was a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol which operationalises the UNFCCC. Here binding emission reduction targets were agreed on, with the EU-15 taking on the highest reduction target <cite>-8%</cite> <cite>Information Services of the UNFCCC secretariat, 2008</cite>. The EU-15 took advantage of what is known as a bubble, which allowed it to redistribute the targets among its member states in order to achieve an overall reduction of -8% <cite>Michaelowa & Betz, 2001</cite>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The international response to climate change by this point was not strong enough, but the EU had proven itself a global leader in the fight against climate change <cite>Oberthür & Kelly, 2008</cite>. This became all the more clear when in 2001 the EU played a vital role in saving the Kyoto Protocol after the Bush Administration had declared its opposition to it <cite>Oberthür & Kelly, 2008</cite>. Subsequently the EU secured an agreement on the rules of meeting the targets of the Kyoto Protocol in the Marrakech Accords <cite>Oberthür & Kelly, 2008</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2005 the EU launched the EU Emission Trading Scheme <cite>EUETS</cite>, the first of its kind in the world <cite>De Perthuis & Trotignon, 2014</cite>. It quickly became the main pillar of EU climate policy and would continue to be improved and expanded upon. Its goal was to help reach the Kyoto targets. Phase one lasted for 3 years and was trial period.  The second period coincided with the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. The performance of the EUETS was hampered by low carbon price caused by overestimation of demand and the recession after the 2008 financial crisis.
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4"><p>
            In 2007 the EU agreed on the 2020 climate and energy package which sets 3 key targets <cite>European Commission, n.d.</cite>:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions <cite>from 1990 levels</cite></li>
            <li>20% of EU energy from renewables <cite>Renewable Energy Directive</cite></li>
            <li>20% improvement in energy efficiency</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The 2020 climate & energy package was adopted in 2009. This commitment was made independently and outside of the UNFCCC framework, thereby showing leadership by example to the world.
        </p>
        <h2>After the Treaty of Lisbon</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Conclusion: The EU has a mandate to fight climate change and has the diplomatic resources to push for global action.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            There were several drivers that pushed climate as a critical part of the Lisbon treaty.
        </p>
        <p>
            First of all, the failure of the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe led the EU to fear a loss of legitimacy. To reinvigorate European integration and enhance their legitimacy, the EU decided to advance its climate policy <cite>Oberthür & Kelly, 2008</cite>. Eurobarometer polls had shown environmental support to be a popular cause and the fourth IPCC assessment report had displayed the rising urgency for climate action <cite>Oberthür & Kelly, 2008</cite>. There was thus an opportunity to tackle both climate change and a drop in legitimacy by focusing on climate policy as the centre for EU integration <cite>Oberthür & Kelly, 2008</cite>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Secondly, oil and gas prices had been trending up, as had been EU  dependency on imported energy <cite>Oberthür & Kelly, 2008</cite>. Imports, especially those from the middle-east and Russia, had long been considered to be a danger to EU sovereignty <cite>Adamson, 1985; Peña-Ramos, Bagus & Amirov-Belova, 2020</cite>. Improving energy efficiency and reducing import  dependency by exploiting renewables was therefore attractive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thirdly, the EU had positioned itself as a strong supporter for international law, multilateralism and global climate action <cite>Oberthür & Kelly, 2008</cite>. The Kyoto Protocol was a high profile testament to EU climate leadership and the EU’s international profile.
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <p>
            These factors led to the Lisbon treaty, which mandated the European Commission to represent the EU externally <cite>except for matters concerning the Common Foreign and Security Policy</cite>, a function that was previously reserved for the EU Council Presidency <cite>Groen & Niemann, 2013</cite>. The European Parliament had received the power to veto international agreements, thereby keeping the European Commission in check <cite>Groen & Niemann, 2013</cite>. The European Commission would also have to keep the European Parliament informed about all negotiations <cite>Groen & Niemann, 2013</cite>. This meant that on future Conferences a of the Parties <cite>COP</cite> of the UNFCCC, the EU would be represented by the European Commission and would have to be supported by the European Parliament. The External Action Service, the diplomatic service of the EU, would support this green diplomacy of the European Commission <cite>Oberthür & Kelly, 2008</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Until the adoption of the Lisbon treaty, the EU/EC had been competent to act in all areas of environment policy as laid out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union <cite>European Parliament , & Kurrer, 2022</cite>. The Treaty of Lisbon amends the Treaty of Rome <cite>renamed to ‘Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union’</cite> and the Maastricht treaty <cite>Treaty of Lisbon, 2007</cite>. Particularly interesting here was the following: 
        </p>
        <blockquote class="light">
            “Union policy on the environment shall contribute to pursuit of the following objectives: […] promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change.” 
        <cite>Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, 2008, Article 191</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            From the enactment of the treaty on, the EU would not just have shared competence in the area of climate change, it would also have a mandate and goal to fight climate change. This made it all the more painful when, during the 2009 COP15 meeting in Copenhagen, the EU was unable to negotiate a legally binding agreement to continue the Kyoto Protocol after 2012 <cite>Groen & Niemann, 2013</cite>. The most likely cause of this failure was the unprecedented degree of politicisation of the negotiations. The EU was pressured form all sides to change its position, by media, NGO’s and political leaders form within and outside the EU. An agreement for a second commitment period <cite>from 2013 to 2020</cite> would however be reached in 2012 in Doha. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The 2015 Paris agreement can however be considered a historical success for EU climate diplomacy <cite>Oberthür & Groen, 2017</cite>. After the Lisbon treaty had entered into force, the EU was a able to use the combined diplomatic potential of the EEAS and its member states <cite>Oberthür & Groen, 2017</cite> to push for an ambitious agreement where the parties agreed to:
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <blockquote class="light">
            “Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change”
            <cite>UNFCCC, 2015, Article 2</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The immediate pledges made in the agreement however fall well short of what is needed to achieve this goal <cite>Oberthür & Groen, 2017</cite>. Nonetheless, the EU seems to have reaffirmed its position as a climate leader in a now multipolar world of climate politics <cite>Oberthür & Groen, 2017</cite>. The Paris Agreement works on five-year cycles for which every country has to provide a national action plan <cite>UNFCCC, 2015</cite>. The first period started in 2020 at the end of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to meet its commitment to the Paris Agreement, the EU adopted the 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework <cite>Kulovesi & Oberthür, 2020</cite> which followed in the footsteps of the 2020 climate and energy package. The new framework set binding emission reductions target of at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 <cite>up from 20% in the 2020 climate and energy package</cite> to be achieved without the use of international carbon credits but including land use, land-use change and forestry <cite>LULUCF</cite> <cite>Kulovesi & Oberthür, 2020</cite>. Just like the 2020 climate and energy package it also included targets for energy efficiency <cite>32,5%, up from 20%</cite> and the share of renewable energy <cite> 32%, up from 20%</cite> as part of the Renewable Energy Directive II <cite>European Commission, n.d. ; Kulovesi & Oberthür, 2020</cite>. The Effort sharing regulation, as part of the 2030 Framework set out the specific binding annual GHG emission reduction targets for the member states in sectors that are not included in the EUETS <cite>Regulation 2018/842, 2018</cite>. The EUETS itself underwent some changes after years of mixed performance. The emission cap was tightened, carbon leakage rules tightened and the size of the Market Stability Reserve (introduced in 2015 to prevent mismatches of supply and demand) was doubled <cite>Kulovesi & Oberthür, 2020</cite>. The 2030 Framework was however not in line with the ambition set out in the Paris Agreement, more action was still needed <cite>Dupont, Oberthür, & Von Homeyer, 2020; Kulovesi & Oberthür, 2020</cite>.

        <h2>The Green Deal and COVID-19 pandemic</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Conclusion: the EU doubled down on its climate ambitions during the COVID-19 pandemic</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2019 the then newly appointed President of the European Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen presented  the European Green Deal <cite>EGD</cite>, as a long term evolving strategy:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="light">
            “It [the EGD] is a new growth strategy that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use.”
            <cite>European Commission, 2019, Chapter 1</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The EGD built on previous policy, by e.g. amending the 2030 Framework “to increase the EU 2030 climate target to at least 50% and towards 55%” <cite>European Commission, 2019, Chapter 2</cite>, but it also introduced new concepts such as the “do no harm” principle <cite>European Commission, 2019</cite> which requires that all EU actions and policies should contribute to the previously mentioned climate goals or at least not hinder progress towards them. The EGD was the basis framework on which new policies should be built to achieve all the goals it set. Very notable is that these goals are not exclusively related to climate, on the contrary, a lot of policies relate to innovation, the economy, energy and energy efficiency, social issues etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic,  the European Climate Law was introduced  - which increased the GHG emissions reduction target to “at least 55%” <cite>European Parliament & European Council, 2021, Article 4 para. 1</cite> - and swiftly followed by the Fit for 55 package which proposed policies to reach that target <cite>Von Homeyer et al., 2022</cite>. The EUETS and Effort Sharing Regulation would be modified and remain the main policy instruments to regulate GHG emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            To support the economy during the pandemic, the EU launched NextGenerationEU <cite>NGEU</cite>, a massive investment programme that enabled the EU to borrow up to EUR 750 billion. 30% of this budget and the Multiannual Financial Framework would have to be invested in programmes that aid the EU’s climate objectives and all of the investments should be consistent with the Paris Agreement <cite>EU Council conclusions, 2020</cite>.

        <h2>The energy crisis</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Conclusion: the EU reacted decisively but was hit hard by high energy prices.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            On February 24 ,2022, Russia escalated the Donbas conflict between the self-declared Donetsk and  Luhansk People’s Republics and Ukraine, by launching an invasion into Ukraine <cite>Dijkstra et al., 2022; Sasse & Lackner, 2018</cite>. The reaction of the EU has been impressive, the first package of sanctions was already agreed on the day before the invasion and since then, many more have followed <cite>Bosse, 2022</cite>. These sanctions were mainly economic and financial in nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            The EU’s reaction also contained many first time actions, such as supplying military support under the European Peace Facility, and activating the Temporary Protection Directive, thereby allowing Ukrainian nationals the right to live, work, access health-care, housing, and education in the EU for three years, without the requirement to go through lengthy asylum procedures <cite>Bosse, 2022</cite>. The EU’s resolve in the wake of the war was impressive, even more so the decision to give EU candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova even though the EU had already been suffering from enlargement fatigue <cite>Bosse, 2022</cite>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Russia was quick to retaliate and use its power as the main energy supplier to the EU as leverage as it had already been doing before the escalation, but the EU hit back with sanctions on energy imports from Russia in the sixth sanctions package. Already on May 18, 2020 the European Commission presented REPowerEU a plan to rapidly reduce  dependence on Russian energy imports, reduce energy consumption and fast forward the green transition. REPowerEU increased the binding target for renewable energy production capacity to 42,5% by 2030 <cite>European Commission, 2023</cite>. This is a 10 point increase from the 32.5% set out in the 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework. It also mobilised 300 billion euro in funding which will primarily be used to speed up the energy transition <cite>European Council, 2023</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The impact of the sanctions and REPowerEU on the diversification of energy imports was as desired, the share of Russian gas in total imports plummeted from an average of 50% before the escalation to 25% between January and November 2022 <cite>European Council, 2023</cite>. Most of the Russian imports were substituted by Norwegian and Algerian pipeline gas and LNG imports from the USA, Qatar and Nigeria <cite>European Council, 2023</cite>. Solid fuel imports from Russia were prohibited on 8 April 2022 and later crude oil and derivatives followed <cite>with some exceptions</cite> <cite>Euronews, 2023</cite>. These sanctions on Russian energy, specifically natural gas, combined with the limited substitutability of suppliers contributed to spiking energy prices <cite>see Fig. 3.B</cite>.

        <p>
            The energy situation in Europe was also troubled by a plunge in nuclear and hydroelectric energy capacity <cite>see Fig. 3.A.</cite>. The worst draught in 500 years led directly to diminished hydroelectric [-19% capacity] output and together with high temperatures constrained the cooling systems of nuclear energy plants <cite>Jones, 2023</cite>. Nuclear power saw a drop of 16% of which 27% was due to the closure of German plants and 69% due to outages in French plants <cite>Jones, 2023</cite>.

            The rising energy prices quickly fuelled inflation and a cost of living crisis <cite>see Fig. 3.A</cite>. Through the LNG spot market there were heavy spill-over effects of these problems to other markets which competed for the same contracts as the EU. This was exacerbated by large OPEC+ supply cuts <cite>Ghaddar, Lawler, Edwards, 2022</cite>. The rising gas and prices also hit European industry very hard, gas or energy intensive industries had to halt production, leave the EU or depend on subsidies. The reduced demand from industry, buildings and power generation combined to 10% of the 2021 demand for gas or 50bcm <cite>IEA, 2022</cite>.

        <p>
            In order to mitigate the rising energy prices, the EU, in cooperation with the G7 and Australia imposed a global price cap of 60 USD per barrel on Russian oil, starting from February 2023 <cite>Golubkova & Murakami,  2023</cite>. The goal is to keep Russian energy flowing into global markets and thereby reduce prices while reducing Russia’s profits and ability to fund its war effort. Also in February 2023, a European price cap on gas was introduced which will trigger if first-month Dutch Title Transfer Facility <cite>TTF, a common benchmark for European gas prices</cite> prices exceed 180 euro per megawatt hour <cite>Abnett, 2022</cite>. However, this price cap was arguably too late since prices had already been trending downwards since the peak in August 2022, and had been trading below the 180 euro ceiling since September 2022 <cite>Fig. 3.C.</cite>.

        <p>
            In order to secure energy supplies for the winter, the EU adopted the EU Gas Storage Regulation through a fast-track procedure <cite>European Commission, 2022</cite>. This regulation set a fill target of 80% of total gas storage capacity by November 2022 which would increase to 90% for subsequent years. The EU also committed to reducing gas consumption by 15% in the Council Regulation on coordinated demand reduction measures for gas  to help reach the storage targets <cite>President of the European Commission, 2022</cite>.

        <h1>Theoretical background</h1>
        <p>
            The EU has a rich history of crises and responses to them, Jean Monnet – considered to be one of the founding fathers of the European Union – famously wrote “Europe will be forged in crises and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises” <cite>De Vries, 2022, p. 6</cite>. Explaining why the EU reacted to a crisis in a certain way is difficult. Many different theories and frameworks exist to account for the behaviour of the EU and its members, in this chapter I will first describe what a crisis is. Then I will present the most prevalently used frameworks to explain the strengthening, weakening  and crisis responses of the EU. Finally I will touch on grounded theory and how I draw from it in my research methodology.
        </p>
        <h2>Crisis</h2>
        <p>
            Although the word crisis is commonly used in the press to refer to an unexpected or undesired situation, in academics the term has a different meaning. A crisis is a period of disorder in the development of a system, they occur when members of that system sense that their core values or features are threatened  and feel like this threat must urgently be addressed <cite>Boin et al., 2016</cite>. The more fundamental these values under threat are, the stronger the feeling of crisis <cite>Boin et al., 2016</cite>. Crises require exceptional management capacity from leaders because of the extraordinary circumstances it generates for governments. They can however also create opportunities for change <cite>De Vries, 2022; Boin et al., 2016</cite>. When people feel threatened or shocked, this can create political momentum and incite criticism for the current order and a desire for change. A strong leader which displays a capacity for crisis management can exploit this appetite for change to further his own goals <cite>Boin & al., 2016</cite>. In the words of Winston Churchill “Never let a good crisis go to waste” <cite>Gruère & OECD, 2019, para 1</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feelings are central to the definition of a crisis, this makes crises also a psychological matter. Human perception is based on intuition and mental short-cuts which lead to biases <cite>Bell, 2017</cite>.  
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <h2>Neorealism</h2> 
        <p>
            Realism is the oldest theory of international relations, tracing back its roots to ancient Greece <cite>Armstrong et al., 2012</cite> and therefore even predating the modern state. Because of this long history, realist thought is quite varied. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Classical realism was built on the ideas of Thucydides, Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes <cite>Korab-Karpowicz & Julian, 2018</cite> and it paints a picture of an anarchistic world filled with individualistic people struggling for power. Hobbes, e.g., described people as egoistic and subject to “a perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that ceases only in death” <cite>Korab-Karpowicz & Julian, 2018</cite>. Realists reject the idea of universal moral principles and therefore permit the use of immoral actions for reasons of state, in their view war is a tool. They view the world as anarchistic with an ever-present risk of war <cite>Korab-Karpowicz & Julian, 2018</cite>. On this international arena, states are free to pursue their own objectives and they are liable for their own survival <cite>Korab-Karpowicz & Julian, 2018</cite>. Hobbes described life as “brutish and short” <cite>Armstrong et al., 2012</cite>. Realists view states as the only important actors and do not pay attention to individuals. The assumption that all these actors are rational and strive to maximize their power means that their behaviour can be studied scientifically.
        </p>
        <p>
            The twentieth century saw a rise in popularity of realism during the interbellum, as a countermovement to the liberal internationalist ideas that flourished after the First World War <cite>Armstrong et al., 2012</cite>. Liberal internationalists wanted to secure lasting peace through the creation of international law enforced by international institutions such as the League of Nations <cite>Korab-Karpowicz & Julian, 2018; Armstrong et al., 2012</cite>. Classical realists called these ideals of international cooperation utopianism and contrasted them with empirical facts <cite>e.g. the rise of Nazism in Germany and the failure of the League of Nations</cite> <cite>Armstrong et al., 2012</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the mid-1970s Kenneth Waltz’s neoliberalism, also known as structural realism, gained prominence. Waltz transformed the practical knowledge offered by classical realism into scientific knowledge <cite>Hyde-Price, 2012</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although realism is the most prevalent theory of international relations, it has been understudied in the context of the EU <cite>Riddervold, Trondal,  & Newsome, 2020</cite>. This is mostly because it does not believe in institutionalised international cooperation and therefore viewed the EU as an anomaly that would disappear after the cold war <cite>Collard-Wexler, 2006</cite>. Realism cannot fully explain the EU’s continued existence <cite>Collard-Wexler, 2006</cite>. This led to realism being a prominent theoretical school when explaining events of disintegration such as Brexit <cite>Rosamond, 2016</cite>.
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <h2>Liberalism and liberal intergovernmentalism</h2>
        <p>
            Classical liberalism paints a more positive picture of humanity and - in many ways - is a counterargument to realism. It is a theory of international relations that was first laid out by John Locke in 1960 and proposes that “all men are born free and equal, with the capacity to reason and hence cooperate” <cite>Armstrong et al., 2012, p. 88</cite>. This would mean that humanity is not inherently linked to war because war would hurt people’s lives and wellbeing <cite>Armstrong et al., 2012</cite>. War would however serve states by centralising power through mobilisation and resource acquisition  <cite>Armstrong et al., 2012</cite>. Liberalism holds the values of democracy in high regard, both John Locke and Immanuel Kant argued for a democracy with a strong and independent legislature to keep the executive power in check. In this social contract the power of the government would get out of balance with the individual liberties of the people. This belief that state power is a problem is completely opposed to that of realists who view strong states as essential to survive in an anarchic world and do not perceive personal liberties to be of importance. Immanuel Kant added one more prescription for perpetual peace: increased international trade and personal contacts. In the words of John Stuart Mill in 1848: ‘it is commerce which is rapidly rendering war obsolete, by strengthening and multiplying the personal interests which act in natural opposition to it’. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To the discredit of liberalism, increased trade did not prevent the First World War, nor did democracy and  international institutions such as the League of Nations prevent the Second World War. As a result, liberalists were dismissed as utopian dreamers.
        </p>
        <h2>Liberal intergovernmentalism </h2>
        <p>
            Andrew Moravcsik published his paper “Preferences and Power in the European Community” in 1993, in which he put forward his theory of liberal intergovernmentalism <cite>LI</cite> <cite>Kleine & Pollack, 2018</cite>. It combines traditional realist intergovernmentalism with liberal ideas <cite>Riddervold et al., 2020</cite>. LI tries to elucidate the factors driving European integration and has become the leading theory for doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like realist intergovernmentalism, LI views nations as the primary actors on the international stage, but it borrows the liberal idea that the society within the state can influence international politics. State preferences are therefore formed domestically, and are not inherent to the state itself. This means that every act on the international stage will have domestic consequences and create winners and losers. In fields where the losses are diffuse or borne by a non-dominant actor, integration is possible if it concentrates the gains to the ruling actors <cite>Kleine & Pollack, 2018</cite>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This idea that European integration is not driven by geopolitical factors and pushed by supranational elites, but rather by member states who are in full control of the process, is central to LI. National preference formation is the first stage of integration according to LI.
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <p>
            The second stage of integration is intergovernmental bargaining <cite>Riddervold et al., 2020</cite>. Here member states negotiate in order to fond a common interest. Contrary to the realist view which assumes this to be a zero sum game, Moravcsik proposes that states can form some sort of asymmetric interdependence which benefits all <cite>Kleine & Pollack, 2018</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third stage is institutional choice, this is when governments appoint institutions to safeguard the bargain they struck. Assigning this task to a supranational institution and thereby pooling sovereignty both ensures that other countries will follow up on their commitments by separating the agreement from national politics or intergovernmental control, and raises the prestige of the supranational institution <cite>Kleine & Pollack, 2018; Riddervold et al., 2020</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the theories of international relations would be fitting in the case of the energy crisis. The cause of the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian war has been a topic of hot debate, in which Russia is widely regarded as an actor that handles according to realist principles and the West adhering more to liberal ideas  <cite>McFaul, Sestanovich, & Mearsheimer, 2014</cite>. Forms of realism and liberalism have been used for a long time to explain crises in the EU, EU - Russia relations and also the geopolitical consequences of the European green deal <cite>Riddervold et al., 2020</cite>. In analyses of the last topic, Russia often takes centre stage <cite>Leonard, Pisani-Ferry, Shapiro, Tagliapietra, & Wolff 2021; Romanova, 2021; Siddi, 2021; Telegina & Khalova, 2022</cite>.

            There are however certain problems that prevent me from using the dominant theories of international relations as the basis for my research. First of all, in these frameworks national governments are seen as the primary actors. An analysis of the EU would therefore require the analysis of all member states and the interactions between them. Doing so would not just take a lot of time but I doubt that it is even possible because of the accumulation of errors and assumptions that such an endeavour would entail. Secondly, in my opinion, these frameworks cannot adequately explain the drivers behind climate ambition and policy. Realism offers Waltz’s theory of balance as an explanation for how countries could work together to fight climate change, by joining alliances to balance against the threat of climate change <cite>CGSRS, 2015</cite>.  This theory does, in my opinion, not explain any climate ambition beyond the targets set out by the alliance, in this case the UNFCCC. Nor does it give a solution to the problem of freeriding on the climate action of other nations. Recently there have been additions to the realist literature that propose so called climate realism which seeks to provide answers to these problems, but they have not been consolidated or widely accepted.

            LI doesn’t have an explanation for climate ambition either. It offers an explanation on how climate policy can be formed on a European level by integrating the interests of the member states, but it considers these interests to be exogenous. So although LI could be used to explain why certain climate policy would be enacted as a result of member state integration, it cannot explain the European Commission or Council as a policy entrepreneur. Therefore LI would not be able to explain long term climate ambition driven by the EU.

        <h2>Institutionalism </h2>
        <p>
            Institutionalism studies institutions and the way they interact with and shape society. Institutions are considered to be more persistent through time, and therefore create long lasting effects <cite>Riddervold, Trondal,  & Newsome, 2020</cite>. It is however not a unified body of thought, within institutionalism there are different varieties. Old institutionalism was most popular in the late nineteenth century  until the interwar period. It focused exclusively on formal structures of government on a more abstract level and was rooted in economics, political sciences and sociology <cite>Adcock, Bevir, & Stimson, 2007</cite>. New institutionalism started to develop in reaction to behaviouralism, in the mid-1980s and through the 1990s in the USA <cite>Adcock et al., 2007</cite> and took a broader frame of reference. Within new institutionalism there are many streams, Thelen <cite>1999</cite> and  Hall & Taylor <cite>1996</cite> distinguish three  different varieties of new institutionalism: sociological, rational choice and historical institutionalism. Since 2008, Schmidt’s discursive institutionalism has also gained prominence.
        </p>
        <h3>Rational choice institutionalism</h3>
        <p>
            Rational choice institutionalism <cite>RI</cite> views institutions as stable and use them to explain equilibria in a dynamic reactive society <cite>Riddervold et al., 2020</cite>. Institutions set the rules for politics <cite>Riddervold et al., 2020</cite>  by changing the transaction costs of certain actions and by allocating agenda setting privileges. Individuals are presumed to react rationally to those rules in order to attain their preferences in a highly strategic manner <cite>Hall & Taylor, 1996</cite>. Because they all react to further their own interests, the eventual outcome may be negative for the collective. People will only engage in interactions that benefit themselves <cite>objective or material goals</cite>, these interactions can be facilitated or be made unavailable by institutions <cite>Hall & Taylor, 1996</cite>.  Institutions are considered to be static, originating only when their existence would realise a certain value for the actors <cite>Hall & Taylor, 1996</cite>. RI therefore has a view of society and humanity that is more akin to game theory and the homo economicus and it pays less attention to sociological and historical factors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since my research is focused on the impact of the crisis on the EU, an institution, this branch of institutionalism is not useful to me.
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <h3>Sociological institutionalism</h3>
        <p>
            Sociological institutionalism <cite>SI</cite> was a reaction from sociologists who wanted to challenge the commonly made distinction between the parts of the world that were associated to rationality  and those associated with culture <cite>Hall & Taylor, 1996</cite>. The former were said to be modern efficient bureaucratic institutions, the latter a diverse set of practices. Sociological institutionalists however, argued that these modern institutions were not set up because of rational goals but should rather be viewed as a means to transmit culturally-specific practices <cite>Hall & Taylor, 1996</cite>. They propose that institutions and bureaucracies are inherently linked to culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            SI is mostly used to analyse why organisations take on certain structures and symbols. It has a broader definition for the concept institution, because it does not distinguish institutions from culture. SI’s relationship between individuals and institutions is quite distinctive. It associates institutions with roles, the norms of behaviour attached to these institutions are internalised by the individuals that socialise into those roles <cite>Hall & Taylor, 1996</cite>. In this way, institutions influence the behaviour of individuals. Learning and socialisation mechanisms are therefore central to SI. This focus on the individual however, makes it unfit for my research purposes.
        </p>
        <h3>Historical institutionalism </h3>
        <p>
            Historical institutionalism <cite>HI</cite> views institutions as a result of concrete historical processes, they are therefore variable through time. HI was influenced by functionalists from whom it borrowed the vision that different parts of society influence each other <cite>Hall & Taylor, 1996</cite>. HI however focused on the institutional organisation rather than social, psychological or cultural traits as driving parameters <cite>Hall & Taylor, 1996</cite>. It does still take these factors into account when analysing how a political outcome is reached. HI is therefore more eclectic, both applying a calculus and cultural approach <cite>Hall & Taylor, 1996</cite>. The idea is that institutions distribute power among social groups and ideas, thereby influencing society and other institutions. They can also create incentives which reinforce the existing institutions. Because of the persistence of institutions, these influences are lasting and create a historical legacy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            HI pays less attentions to how individuals behaviour is influenced by institutions than other streams of new institutionalism <cite>Hall & Taylor, 1996</cite>. Rather, timing and the sequence of events lay at the heart of HI. Events and reactions are considered to be time-dependant and path dependant <cite>Hall & Taylor, 1996</cite>. 
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <p>
            These path dependant processes can be punctuated by critical junctures. Cappocia & Kelemen <cite>2007, p. 348</cite> define critical junctures as “relatively short periods of time during which there is a substantially heightened probability that agents' choices will affect the outcome of interest”. In this period of manoeuvrability, political actors can propose new policies and incite change. Once the probability that agents’ actions will affect political outcomes reverts back to normal, the choices that were made during the previous critical juncture are locked-in. Agents no longer have the same amount of options and the ability to choose between them. This period when policy has crystallised is known as the reproductive stage, which starts when a path-dependant process is initiated <cite>Cappocia & Kelemen, 2007</cite>. This dual model of “shorter phases of fluidity and change alternating with longer periods of stability and adaptation” <cite>Cappocia, 2015, p. 348</cite> is central to historical institutionalism.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to note that a critical juncture always has to trigger a path-dependant process. When trying to find the origin of a feature of a society, it is often difficult to know how far back one has to go. Event A can be caused by B which was caused by C etc. , going back to the birth of civilisation. This problem - ending up with an infinitely-long causal chain – is called infinite regress <cite>Munck, 2021</cite>. Critical junctures can solve this problem by providing a direct causal relation to events in the subsequent period of path-dependency. Naturally causality can only be determined after the fact, which complicates the study of contemporary events such as the current energy crisis. Therefore I will only be able to gauge the possibility that the energy crisis will constitute a critical juncture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Critical junctures are typically caused by an external shock, but not all policy areas have to be affected to the same extent <cite>Cappocia & Kelemen, 2007</cite>.  Historical institutionalism does leave the door open for gradual endogenous change, Mahoney & Thelen <cite>2010, p. 15-16</cite> identify four types of institutional change: 
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>Displacement: the removal of existing rules and the introduction of new ones</li>
                <li>Layering: the introduction of new rules on top of or alongside existing ones</li>
                <li>Drift: the changed impact of existing rules due to shifts in the environment</li>
                <li>Conversion: the changed enactment of existing rules due to their strategic redeployment</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            A critical juncture can be relevant to just one or more domains. It is therefore important to clearly specify the scope of the research, in this case, climate ambition.
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <p>
            The requirement for change is conspicuously absent in the definition of a critical juncture, a heightened possibility of change is sufficient. This is because a reaffirmation of current policy in a period where change was possible or likely can provide sufficient causality. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The flexibility of HI and its focus on critical junctures makes it an interesting framework for my research. The crisis is caused by an external shock, the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian war, which is generally the case for critical junctures. Critical junctures provide direct causality, which would mean that if the energy crisis is a critical juncture, it would trigger a period of path dependency and it would therefore be clear what the effect of the crisis was. HI thus provides concepts that map well onto my goal of gauging the consequences of the energy crisis. It is however difficult to measure ’the probability that agents' choices will affect the outcome of interest’. Therefore I will use elements of discursive institutionalism - which itself borrows a lot from HI - to frame my research. Combining forms of institutionalism is not uncommon, there is no single interpretation of any of the frameworks anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            Literature from new institutionalism highlights the importance of counterfactual analysis, to demonstrate that another path was available and that this alternative would also have had a lasting legacy <cite>Cappocia, 2015; Cappocia & Kelemen, 2007; Soifer, 2012</cite>. Only if both conditions can be reasonably argued to be met can we speak of a critical juncture. Although a what-if analysis seems very much open to speculation and interpretation, there are guidelines and criteria for a good counterfactual scenario. First of all, historical consistency, also known as the “minimal-rewrite rule” <cite>Cappocia, 2015</cite> limits the policy options that should be included in the analysis to those that were “available, considered, and either not pursued by the relevant actors or narrowly defeated” <cite>Cappocia, 2015</cite>. Secondly, theoretical consistency, permissive and productive conditions for the counterfactual scenario should have been present <cite>Soifer, 2012</cite>.
        </p>
        <h3>Discursive institutionalism</h3>
        <ul>
            A more recent stream of new institutionalism outlined by Schmidt <cite>2008</cite> is discursive institutionalism <cite>DI</cite> which developed in the beginning of this century and proposes a more dynamic agent-centred approach than HI <cite>Schmidt, 2008</cite>. These agents can have subjective goals and ideas, which goes against RI’s idea of a rational agent with objective goals <cite>Schmidt, 2008</cite>. Institutions are seen as the context in which agents think <cite>Ladi, 2011</cite>. As the name suggests, DI focuses on the power of discourse and ideas. Discourses determine whether or not an idea gets accepted. Schmidt <cite>2008</cite> argues that discourses can exert causal influence on future,
            <li>by eliminating or promoting ideas and thereby convincing actors of the need to act in a certain way</li>
            <li>by creating collective memories and forming culture <cite>which DI sees as a form of institution because it influences the way people think and make decisions</cite></li>
            <li>by reframing historical events and thereby providing a new narrative</li>
            <li>by opening a window of opportunity for new policy</li>
        </ul>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <p>
            This view aligns well with the heightened probability for change implied by the definition offered by Cappocia & Kelemen <cite>2007</cite> in HI. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Soifer <cite>2012</cite> argues that for a crisis to become a critical junctures, it requires the presence of permissive and productive conditions. Permissive “conditions mark the loosening of constraints on agency” <cite>Soifer, 2012, p. 1</cite> and open a window of opportunity for change which is again akin to the heightened probability of agent impact described by Cappocia & Kelemen <cite>2007</cite>. Productive conditions push for a particular outcome, and this is where DI can provide an extra explanatory layer on top of HI. Schmidt <cite>2008</cite> criticizes the lack of explanatory power for critical junctures in HI. By analysing the content of the discourse and how it can be considered a productive condition, it is possible to analyse not only whether or not the energy crisis could be a critical juncture, but also whether the productive conditions push for more, less, or an unchanged amount of ambition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Schmidt <cite>2008</cite> distinguishes two kinds of discourse:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Coordinative discourse</b> occurs in the policy sphere where policy actors discuss the creation and justification of policy. These actors are generally civil servants and elected officials but can also include any other actors that can influence policy creation.</li>
    
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Communicative discourse</b> takes place in the political sphere. Here agents present and discuss political ideas with the general public. A wider range of actors is involved in this sphere because it also includes people who do not have the power to make decisions on policy but do provide ideas and opinions on what should be done(e.g. media personalities, opposition parties, activists, intellectuals, etc.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The general public towards whom this discourse is oriented also plays an important role here because they can express themselves and make themselves heard through elections.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Interweaving these two types of discourse results in a master discourse which “provides a vision of where the polity is, where it is going, and where it ought to go” <cite>Schmidt, 2008, p. 311</cite>. Both of these kinds of discourse should thus be taken into account when analysing the discourse surrounding a certain topic. It is therefore important to take note of the role of the actors in the discourse.   
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in the definition of critical junctures provided by Cappocia & Kelemen <cite>2007</cite>, on which I will base my research, agents that can affect political outcomes are central. The perspective of these actors is best captured by the coordinative discourse so I will focus on that part of the discourse in my research.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <p>
            Historical narratives are ideas and stories that governments or institutions use to frame their choices. They are selected in the communicative discourse and can be used to justify current actions and to explain the past <cite>De Vries, 2022</cite>. Hereby narratives also limit the amount of options available to policymakers <cite>De Vries, 2022</cite>, because their choices have to be in line with their current narrative. A shift in the dominant narrative can thus open up new options and make previous options unavailable to policymakers. According to the definition offered by Cappocia & Kelemen <cite>2007</cite>, such a shift would constitute a critical juncture as long as the choices were relevant. Analysing narratives can therefore be a useful tool for the research of critical junctures.

        <h1>Research</h1>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <h3>Qualitative research and grounded theory</h3>
        <p>
            In order to detect whether the energy crisis was a critical juncture, I used a qualitative method based on grounded theory and document analysis. Since the concept of a critical juncture is qualitative by nature it makes sense to use qualitative methods. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are no definitions or methods that provide a quantitative tests for critical junctures. I have at one point considered devising a test which does so based on the price of carbon credit futures prices from the EUETS, but literature on the pricing of these products is in my opinion not sufficiently developed to build such a method on. I might however be an interesting project for other researchers. I believe that the market expectations embedded in market prices can be very valuable when gauging the credibility of climate policy.
        </p>
         
        <p>
            Grounded theory is a type of methodology for qualitative research which emerged in the social sciences in the 1960s <cite>Charmaz, 2006</cite>. It is an inductive approach which seeks to find theory, grounded in the analysed data itself. This is usually done by codifying documents, this means analysing the text using a coding technique to assign it to a certain category. These categories are not decided on ahead, but emerge during the coding process. This lack of preconceptions ensures that the final theory or conclusion results from the data itself which goes against the prevalent way of working where a theory is first devised and later proven with data.
        </p>
        <p>
            I reviewed the conclusions put forward by the European Commission and took note of the amount of conclusions that mention climate policy and classified the context in which it is mentioned. To classify the conclusions I codified them using methods from The coding manual for Qualitative researchers  by Saldana <cite>2012</cite> and Constructing grounded theory, a practical guide through qualitative analysis by Charmaz <cite>2006</cite>. I performed the same analysis on the State of the Union speeches since 2017. This is yearly data, so the resolution is very low but they might give more insight because they give the view of the European Commission.
        </p>
        <p>
            If it is possible to identify distinctive narrative periods, this would indicate a critical juncture. A change in narrative would be the result of a discourse and transform the environment in which policy is created. The dominant narrative would also provide an explanation for why a critical juncture would have certain effects, because it gives the arguments and ideas that brought and will sustain the change and therefore acts as a productive factor. 
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>
            The European Council meets at least four times per year. In these meetings which are chaired by the President of the European Council, the heads of states of all EU countries discuss European laws and policy. To finalise a meeting, the European Council adopts its Conclusions by consensus. These Conclusions are used to identify specific issues and propose or demand actions. The European Council can also influence the EU policy agenda by setting deadlines for agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that European Council Conclusions provide a good source of data because they are unanimously put forward by all member states, and therefore provide a good indication of the EU-wide narrative surrounding climate. Climate will only be mentioned if it was first put on the agenda and a unanimously agreed upon, this would then immediately indicate that there was a discourse and that a dominant narrative or view was accepted. This is very interesting in the context of discursive institutionalism.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, looking exclusively at European Council Conclusions does bring some problems. First of all it means that I will be focusing exclusively on the coordinative discourse and I will have no arguments stemming from the communicative discourse to support a conclusion.  Due to the meeting schedule of the European Council, I will only have four datapoints per year. I think it is important to acknowledge this lack of granularity. It is however highly unlikely that discursive periods will be completely and strictly separated because discussions take time to conclude. So on the timescale of EU policy I believe the resolution of data should be sufficient for a trend to be visible should there be one. In the same vain it is also expectable that policy will not map perfectly on the current discursive period. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is why I decide to also review State of the Union speeches by the European President. Thes are directed towards the whole world so they will give an impression of the communicative discourse.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to include the period before the EGD in my analysis because it allows me to contrast the periods before and after EGD and COVID-19 pandemic which both have been put forward as potential critical junctures <cite>Dupont et al., 2020</cite>. These events may therefore be useful as analogues for the energy crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
            I excluded the conclusions from the Special Article 50 meetings because they are uniquely focused on Brexit and therefore never mention climate. Including them would give a skewed impression.
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <h3>Data analysis</h3>
        <p>
            As an exploratory method I used a form of holistic coding <cite>Saldana, 2012</cite> to get a feel for the data. I assigned simple codes to every conclusion that mentioned climate. These codes gave me a sense of the possible categories of context for climate talks. This insight helped me to detect developing categories during the first coding cycle. Here I used initial coding, an open ended coding method <cite>Charmaz, 2006</cite> where I thoroughly analysed every conclusion and assigned very specific codes that where close to the content of the text. By this time I could distinguish several broader categories of contexts, but I wanted to keep an open mind. Only in the second cycle did I use focused coding to inductively identify the most salient categories <cite>Charmaz, 2006</cite>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Having analysed all the conclusions since 2017, I have identified seven contexts in which climate was mentioned. 
        </p>
        <h4>UNFCCC</h4>
        <p>
            Here the goal of limiting global temperature increase is central. Policies are justified by their impact on climate change and their necessity for compliance with UNFCCC goals such as the ones laid out in the Paris Agreement. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A conclusion was classified to this category if it mentions climate action within the EU as a goal and explicitly connects it to the UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement, a COP or the good of the planet. They all either mention the need to meet the Paris Agreement objectives or promote stronger climate ambitions in the UNFCCC context.
        </p>
        <h4>Climate policy as part of a wider social/ economic reform</h4>
        <p>
            Here climate policy is part of a package which aims to reform the economy and/or social situation. Combatting climate change is not necessarily the main objective but the fight against climate change is used as a catalyst to set a wider reform in motion.
        </p>
        <p>
            A conclusion was classified to this category if it mentions climate action along with, or explicitly connects it with, social and/or economic goals. I view goals such as a move to a circular economy, or increased climate resiliency to be economic in nature and will thereby also classify them under this category. This is because they make the link between climate and the economy. The term economic is thus broader than just GDP <cite>growth</cite> but also encompasses the link between humanity’s household and the natural household. A special focus on competitiveness seems to be present throughout this category.
        </p>
        <h4>Diplomacy:</h4>
        <p>
            Climate was mentioned in the context of relations with a specific country or general climate diplomacy. Climate is not always the main topic of the interaction with that country, sometimes it is used as a topic to find common ground in. In other situations increased climate ambition is the main objective.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <h4>Finance</h4>
        <p>
            Conclusions about climate finance, usually related to the European Investment Bank or the MFF. These discuss how the climate transition should be financed and set targets for climate finance. NGEU was strongly present in these conclusions.
        </p>
        <h4>Policy</h4>
        <p>
            These conclusions are not related to a specific field but rather discuss the specifics of a certain policy or within which constraints.
        </p>
        <h4>Climate goals aligned with strategy</h4>
        <p>
            Here strategy is the main driver of the narrative but the strategic interests are aligned with the goal of fighting climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
            A conclusion was classified to this category if it couples the goals of climate neutrality to military or energy security ambitions.
        </p>
        <h4>Other</h4>
        <p>
            Lastly a conclusion was classified under other if it did not match the criteria for the previous categories. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Naturally there was significant overlap between categories, e.g. the need to step up global climate ambition was part of the climate diplomacy and UNFCCC context. Investments and financing methods were the core of the finance category but climate finance was also mentioned with regard to the UNFCCC. But I am confident that the categories I chose are sufficiently salient and that further aggregation would lead to diminished interpretability.

            I codified the paragraphs of the State of the Union speeches that mention climate into the same categories. But due to the low resolution, the fact that there was no State of the Union address in 2019 – the year of the EGD – and the 2023 State of the Union is still to come, this data seems to be less insightful.

        <p>
            There is a noticeable difference in the contexts in which climate is mentioned between the Council conclusions and the State of the Union speeches. I believe this is because the former are part of the coordinative discourse, the later are – because they are directed towards everyone  – part of the communicative discourse. Both parts of the discourse are interesting for a complete analysis, the communicative discourse is influenced by the electorate, the coordinative only directly by political actors. For the detection of critical junctures however I do not think that the data of the State of the Union Speeches is of much use because of the gaps and low resolution. The coordinative discourse was the most important to because it gave the perspective of the policy actors which, in the definition of a critical juncture, is central.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
            <i>The period after the EGD will provide a comparative baseline for my analysis of the current energy crisis. I will argue that the EGD followed by the COVID-19 crisis was a critical juncture.</i>
        </p>
        <h3>EGD and COVID-19</h3>
        <h4>Narratives and discourse</h4>
        <p>
            To analyse a possible critical juncture a comparative analysis of the situation before and after is crucial. The quick succession of the COVID-19 crisis and the energy crisis makes this comparison more difficult even more so because the former was still ongoing during the latter. The resolution of my data is not sufficient to distinguish between the announcement of the EGD <cite>December 2019</cite> and the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic so I will group them together. These events coincide with a noticeable spike in the amount of conclusions that mention climate <cite>see Fig. 5.B.</cite>. They also mark the introduction of several new categories of context in which climate was mentioned. Whereas the UNFCCC category was the dominant context for climate before this critical period, afterwards climate was mentioned for the first time in a social or economic, policy, finance, and diplomatic context and the category of climate finance also became more prevalent. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Climate action became more coupled with, and engrained in economic and social reform to restart the stagnating European economies. This is visible in the data as the rise in volume of the economic/ social category. Several conclusions explicitly mentioned the objective to “mainstream” climate action, which they seem to have been successful in <cite>e.g. European Council, 2020</cite>. The EGD and Climate Law signify that the EU has aligned its economic, social and diplomatic goals with its climate goals, whereas these would have previously been viewed as more separate. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Such an increase in volume and shift in context was used by Papadimitriou, Pegasiou and Zartaloudis <cite>2018</cite> to identify critical junctures in the discourse surrounding the Greek financial crisis. In this case they would signal the EGD and COVID-19 period as a critical juncture. Its legacy would then be enshrined in the Climate Law (9 July 2021) which increased the EU’s CO2 emission reduction target to “at least 55%” <cite>Regulation <cite>EU</cite> 2021/1119</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking at the historical legacy  of this period, the ambition described in the Climate Law is still the main climate target of the EU. It has endured the volatility of the COVID-19 pandemic and the energy crisis. Implementation of the EGD has also continued throughout this time which has engrained climate goals in other fields of policy. This would lead me to interpret it as the start of a path-dependant period. And the EGD would therefore constitute a critical juncture.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <p>
            The narrative behind this increased ambition and the EGD is that:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="light">
            <p>
                “It [the EGD] is a new growth strategy that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050 and where economic growth is decoupled from resource use.”
            </p>
            <cite>European Commission, 2019, Chapter 1</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <h4>Permissive and productive conditions</h4>
        <p>
            As mentioned previously, climate policy in the EU started top-down, as a way for the EU to increase its legitimacy and spur European integration <cite>Oberthür & Kelly, 2008</cite>. In 2018, this high-level politicisation was joined by bottom-up politicisation, spurred on by increased scientific advice on climate change <cite>Dupont et al., 2020</cite>, resulting in the creation of the EGD.
        </p>
        <p>
            The COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis demanded an unprecedently strong response. The European Commission integrated the EGD in the discussion on the response to the COVID-19 crisis <cite>Dupont et al., 2020</cite>. It used its entrepreneurial capabilities to exploit the need for action to advance the implementation of the EGD <cite>Dupont et al., 2020</cite>. 
        </p>
        <h4>Counterfactual Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            The EGD was the result of political factors such as the rising politicisation of climate, and the increasing power of green parties in European countries. The European commission leveraged the COVID-19 crisis to couple the economic recovery package to EGD targets. The ability to mobilise billions of euros in financing for investments in green sectors from the European Budget and NextGenerationEU combined with the rapid implementation of EGD policies has cemented its legacy. The investments made during that short period of economic crisis will pay dividends over the coming years and have paved the way for other investors to follow. EGD policies have also promoted the investment in climate and have engrained climate targets in the European economy. Although climate ambition had been on the rise for decades, the EGD made it definitely clear that green was the way forward and brown was on the way out.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the EGD and COVID-19 crisis to be a critical juncture, there should have been another path that was available and would also have had a historical legacy. Because investments and regulations were the core of the proposed critical juncture, the obvious alternatives are clear. The EU could have decided not to pursue such an ambitious reorientation of its economy towards a greener future, choosing to keep the 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework as the centre of climate policy and foregoing a broader integrated approach to climate. 
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <p>
            During the COVID-19 pandemic there was an expectation that it would transform our way of life. Videos circulated of places that were usually heavily polluted or overpopulated but due to the lockdowns were uniquely beautiful. Foregoing the opportunities for policy entrepreneurship, brought on by the volatility of the pandemic would have sent the signal that there would be no change on the climate front. The EU would muddle through this crisis and come out of it fundamentally unchanged. This would still have required investment and expansionary fiscal policy with special attention for social effects. But climate would not be integrated in this spending and these policies. An absence of change on its own would not have a historical legacy but the narrative and precedent would have. It would have reenforced the divide between climate ambition and economical forces.
        </p>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
            I argue that the EGD and COVID-19 crisis where a critical juncture. The EU was presented with an economic and social crisis which needed radical solutions. It had the choice between expansionary fiscal policy either with or without deep climate integration. Both choices would have had a historical legacy though either investments and lasting policies or through a discursive precedent. The COVID-19 crisis therefore presented the permissive condition for change. The increased politicisation of climate in the form of the EGD combined with the entrepreneurial stance of the European Commission <cite>Dupont et al., 2020</cite> produced the productive conditions that led to the choice for an integrated approach to climate, and higher climate ambitions.
        </p>
        <h3>Energy crisis</h3>
        <p>
            I will try to argue that the energy crisis was not a critical juncture. If I cannot find convincing arguments that meet the requirements set out by the literature, I will reject my hypothesis that it was not a critical juncture and accept the alternative that it was. 
        </p>
        <h4>Narratives and discourse</h4>
        <p>
            In their paper European elites and the narrative of the Greek crisis: A discursive institutionalist analysis, Papadimitriou et al. <cite>2018</cite> define the conditions for critical moments and critical junctures when using a type of data that is similar to mine. They identify a critical moment by a peak in the number of news articles dealing with the subject in their case the Greek financial crisis. The attention created windows of opportunity which could then materialise into critical junctures, which is detected as a fluctuation in the content of discourse using their coding system. 
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <p>
            In the period before and following the escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian war, a shift in the context in which climate is mentioned is visible. The diversity of contexts in which climate is mentioned, dropped significantly and a new contextual category is introduced: strategy. These conclusions tend to co-align the EU’s goal of climate neutrality and its desire for greater energy sovereignty and strategic autonomy. This shift in context and narrative could, according to discursive institutionalism, open  a window of opportunity for new policies and would therefore signify a critical juncture. Its legacy would consist mainly of the increased target for installed renewables capacity which was a part of REPowerEU.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the volume of conclusions that mention climate is significantly lower than during the EGD and COVID-19 period. This would suggest that although a new narrative might be gaining ground, climate might only be related to the greater discourse not at the centre of it. Therefore the shifting narrative would be less likely to be exploited by policy entrepreneurs. This reasoning also works in the other direction, there will be no discussion if there is nothing to be decided on. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So although a new narrative has become dominant, the discussion around climate seems to have disappeared, indicated by the low volume of conclusions mentioning climate. This means that I cannot reject the hypothesis that the energy crisis was not a critical juncture.
        </p>
        <h4>Permissive and productive conditions</h4>
        <p>
            The main condition that would allow for change is clear. Due to the energy crisis, the EU had to rethink its whole energy strategy. The desired energy mix and suppliers had to be revised. Due to the inherent connection between climate and energy policy, this rethinking could have deep rooted consequences for climate ambitions. The options for tackling the crisis were however limited, especially on the short term. Nuclear and hydroelectric generation capacity was at the heart of the crisis and therefore not an option, adding new capacity here would also take years, if not decades. Although gas infrastructure is more scalable, as demonstrated by the rapid construction of LNG infrastructure during the crisis <cite>IEEFA, 2023</cite>, the supply of LNG on the spot market is limited and expensive. Long-term contracts are cheaper but would typically span for 20 to 25 years and are thus not compatible with the goal of climate neutrality by 2050. Domestic production of gas has been on the decline for years and the IEA  <cite>2022</cite> expects this trend to continue through 2023. This left coal, and renewables as the only slack capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
            This indicates the potential for a choice between coal and renewables, the permissive conditions for a critical juncture, but EU countries decided to use both. Investment in the energy transition could only go so fast, and coal was there to temporarily fill the gap. 
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <p>
            Several member states decided to reopen or extend the permitted use of coal plants, however these were not used to capacity and did not drastically impact EU energy generation. By the winter of 2022, the 26 reactivated coal plants only ran at 18% of their capacity <cite>Jones, 2023</cite>. Although the beginning of the energy crisis saw some switching from gas to coal, in the winter of 2022 electricity generation trough coal was already on the decline compared to 2021 <cite>Jones, 2023</cite>.
        </p>
         
        <figure>
            <img src="./Fig6A.png" alt=""  style="height:7.5cm">
            <figcaption>Fig 6.A.: YoY electricity generation trough coal [TWh] <cite>Jones,2023, p. 11</cite></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The point that I am trying to make here is that in reality the energy crisis produced no extra choices available to policy makers. I argue that the legacy of the EGD made the option of a significant shift to coal and lower climate ambition unavailable. By virtue of the binding goals it set out, the investments that had already been made or were in the pipeline and the industrial capacity it had created for renewables, a shift to coal was not necessary. A continuation and enhancement of the previous path was therefore the only option. The use of coal was temporarily necessary but did not start a lasting trend. 
        </p>
        <p>
            These arguments lead me to argue that there were no sufficient permissive conditions for a critical juncture. The energy crisis will definitely leave its mark, but there was no extraordinary potential for change. The EU’s response to the external factors was mostly predetermined by past decisions, and therefore a path-dependant process. The limited investment in modern nuclear capacity and especially the targets set out in the EGD determined the EU’s response. The crisis has continued and built on the legacy of the EGD by increasing investments in the energy transition and increasing energy efficiency targets in the REPowerEU plan.
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <h4>Counterfactual Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            The energy crisis caused a lot of debate about national energy mixes and stirred the debate on nuclear and gas as ‘green’ energy sources in the EU. It would therefore seem that a different path was available to EU policy makers, a return to coal. But as I argued previously, this is not the case. First of all, the path was made unavailable by commitments and investments made as part of the EGD. Secondly there was no real need for a transition to coal, a sizable increase in renewables capacity meant that coal was on the decline again by the end of 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was however one alternative path I did not discuss: a compromise with Russia to ensure the continued flow of pipeline gas. In the months leading up to the escalation of the war there were many attempts to reduce tensions by cooperating <cite>e.g. Reuters, 2022</cite>. Although this option was highly unlikely, there were moments of waning European resolve and there have been several precedents for a compromise with Russia. For example, France signed a 20-25 year agreement for the import of Soviet gas in 1981 while East-West relations were quickly deteriorating and Poland was put under martial law <cite>Adamson, 1985</cite>. Later, Germany went ahead with the construction of Nord Stream 1 and more recently Nord Stream 2. In both cases there was widespread and heavy opposition from Central and Eastern European countries -  who claimed the projects were incompatible with the construction of an EU energy union - and the transatlantic community which claimed it would undermine security goals <cite>Fischer, 2016</cite>. Despite this opposition and the war in Ukraine which started in 2014, Germany did support the project. But even if this scenario was possible, it would mean a continuation of the climate path set out by the EGD and thereby not leave a legacy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So I argue that there were no significantly different alternative reactions to the energy crisis, the response of the EU was broadly fixed by the previous critical juncture in climate policy history, the EGD and COVID-19 crisis. Potential to become a critical juncture. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The energy crisis is still ongoing, fears for its consequences in the winter of 2023 are still prevalent and sometimes unanswered. This means that the situation is still variable and that the energy crisis could still evolve into a critical juncture. The recommendations of the IEA could prove a useful guideline to gauge the potential of the energy crisis to become a critical juncture.
        </p>
        <p>
            The IEA <cite>2022</cite> estimates that another EUR. 100 billion investment is still needed to close the supply-demand gap for 2023. This investment would be used to improve energy efficiency of mainly buildings, increase capacity for renewables, increase the use of heat pumps and biomethane and to reduce the flaring of methane <cite>IEA, 2022</cite>. These actions would result in gas savings amounting to EUR 30 billion and reduce household dependency on gas, thereby reducing the need for government support <cite>IEA, 2022</cite>. 
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <p>
            These proposed actions are in line with the legacy of the EGD – the goal of climate neutrality – and the recent goals and actions of REPowerEU. In fact they would accelerate progress in these areas. So I argue that the EU seems to be on a stable path, set out by the EGD and COVID-19 crisis. Another external shock would thus be needed to get the EU out of this path-dependant process.
        </p>
        <h3>Energy</h3>
        <p>
            My proposition that the energy crisis did not and probably will not constitute a critical juncture does feel strange considering the tumultuous period the EU has gone through recently. Therefore I would like to point out that energy and climate ambition is not as closely coupled as would be expected. The general goal of reducing emissions and eventually reaching can only be reached through comprehensive action in all sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            A temporary setback of progress in the field of electric energy e.g. in the form of a brief rebound of coal-based generation does not mean that the EU will or has abandoned these goals. As long as the long-term energy strategy is aligned with the goal of climate-neutrality I do not perceive short term hiccoughs as a shift in ambitions. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            During the energy crisis there was a noticeable increase of the mentions of energy in European Council conclusions <cite>see Fig. 6.A.</cite>. Some of the more frequently discussed related topics were:
            <li>Reform of the energy market</li>
            <li>Joint purchases</li>
            <li>Energy efficiency and savings</li>
            <li>Energy as a strategic resource</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The last of these points, in combination with the goal of climate neutrality,  maps well onto the strategic category which became the dominant context for climate in the Council conclusions. I interpret this as an indication that the main discourse brought on by the energy crisis was the one surrounding energy and that climate was a sidenote in this debate. This would explain why the context of climate changed but the volume of appearances did not indicate a debate.
        </p>

            I think it would be very interesting to have further research into the possibility of the energy crisis being a critical juncture for energy policy.
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p>
            My research tried to assess whether or not the energy crisis constitutes a critical juncture for EU climate ambitions. The definition of a critical juncture was borrowed from historical institutionalism and extended with concepts and ideas from discursive institutionalism. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I used a qualitative method based on grounded theory and document analysis to count the amount of European Council conclusions that mention climate and codify them into categories based on the context in which they mention climate. Hereby I sought to get an insight into the coordinative discourse surrounding climate policy. Council conclusions are the result of agenda setting and agreement so they are very informative in this aim. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The information I obtained through this method was then used in a discussion where I first used it to argue that the period consisting of the EGD and COVID-19 crisis was a critical juncture. Literature had already suggested so but by reviewing this idea, I could both offer an analysis of the period with a more hindsight perspective and test my own methodology and interpretation of methodological frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the literature suggested, I also concluded that the EGD and COVID-19 crisis were a critical juncture for climate ambition in the EU. This gave me confidence that my chosen criteria were not too strict and that my data was useful to detect a critical juncture. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So in the second part of the discussion I put the data from the energy crisis to the same test. In this case I could not reject my base hypothesis that the energy crisis was not a critical juncture. A consistently low number of conclusions that mentioned climate indicated that there was no rise in discourse associated with the energy crisis. I continued looking for the qualities of a critical juncture which are demanded by literature and were presented by the EGD and COVID-19 crisis. I looked for permissive conditions, and alternative paths in a counterfactual analysis but these reenforced the first conclusion that the energy crisis was not a critical juncture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Subsequently I looked at whether the energy crisis still had the potential to become a critical juncture. But seen as I had presented the current situation as a path-dependent process, a continuation of the crisis would just lead us further among the same path set out by the EGD and COVID-19 critical juncture.
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="A4">
        <p>
            Finally I looked at the interactions between climate and energy discourses. I offer the apparent rise in discourse regarding energy and its overlap with the strategic context in which climate was mentioned during the energy crisis as an explanation for why the context of climate shifted in Council conclusions while volume of climate related Council conclusions did remain low. This leads me to note the analysis of the energy crisis a s an energy related critical juncture as an interesting possible angle for new research.
        </p>
        <p>
            This research contributed to the existing literature on the climate policy of the EU during periods of crisis. The analysis of climate ambition after a critical juncture up until a potential second one enabled a review over time. Methodologically I built on or adapted ideas from different fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            My methodology brought with it some serious limitations, the resolution of my data made it impossible to distinguish between subsequent periods e.g. the EGD and COVID-19 crisis. This problem was even more acute in case of the State of the Union speeches which made them practically useless. This also means that I did look only at the coordinative discourse. Although I identified this as the most relevant, an analysis of the communicative discourse is still necessary for a complete view. The use of coding to generate qualitative data also introduces the potential side effect that the expectations of the coder would influence the resulting data. I tried to keep an open mind without preconceptions but coding is something that requires practice and experience which I did not have when starting my research.
